<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

 
<p>YouTubeSWEg is a state of the art static web app that provides a compilation of YouTube content information easily accessible through our GUI. The goal of the project is to act as an hub for relational information that is usually only accessible through the API. This report outlines the design choices and implementation details involved in creating this application.</p

<a name="UseCase"></a>
<h2>Use Case</h2>

<p>YouTubeSWEg is intended to provide easy access to relational information regarding YouTube videos, channels, category, and playlists. These 4 models are linked together using various relationships to convey their nature. This is clearly expressed in our UML diagram. By utilizing the website, or provided API, users can easily find insights and connections between media and content that they consume on a daily basis.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="Frontend"></a>
<h1>Frontend</h1>

<a name="ContentStructure"></a>
<h2>Content Structure</h2>
 
<p>YouTubeSWEg is an attempt of replicating IMDB in the domain of YouTube content. While the main content of YouTube is multimedia videos, a lot of other content forms the building blocks of YouTube’s structure including channels, playlists, and categories. These components intermingle and are heavily related to each other, and content in one portion can directly and indirectly lead you to content in other portions. Because of this, we chose Videos, Channels, Playlists, and Categories as our four models. Each model contains five chosen attributes. These attributes represent, as they suggest, attributes about each model. The attributes are:
<br />
<br />
Videos – Title, Channel, Description, Thumbnail, Associated Tags, Categories
<br />
Channels – Title, description, date of publication, associated country, related playlists, view count, subscriber count
<br />
Categories – Title, latest published video date, number of videos, assignable, most popular videos from this category, most popular channels uploading to this category
<br />
Playlists – Title, description, associated tags, date of publication, item count
<br />
<br />
 
Each model links to at least two other models. Defining the relationship between models played an important role in the website design later on. The relationships are:
<br />
<br />
Videos link to Channels, Categories
<br />
Channels link to Videos, Playlists
<br />
Categories link to Videos, Channels
<br />
Playlists link to Channels, Videos 
<br />
<br />

The purpose of YouTubeSWEg is to provide very easy access to this information. </p>

<a name="WebsiteDesign"></a>
<h2>Website Design</h2>
 
<p>YouTubeSWEg places the greatest importance on the immersive experience of the user which does not compromise on ease of use. The design is heavily inspired by YouTube’s design and color palette.</p>

<p>It features a navbar on the top of the page that allows for easy navigation and lets you know what page you are currently on. The Navbar links to the following pages:
<br />
<br />
YouTubeSWEg Home page which features a carousel of pictures related to pages
<br />
Videos page containing a table of videos and their associated attributes
<br />
Channels page containing a table of channels and their associated attributes
<br />
Categories page containing a table of categories and their associated attributes
<br />
Playlists page containing a table of playlists and their associated attributes
<br />
About page featuring information about the creators of YouTubeSWEg and other relevant data to the project
<br />
<br />
Each page also features several clickable elements that cause new pages for each individual video, channel, playlist and category to be dynamically rendered by Flask and Jinja. For the rendered video pages the embedded YouTube video is present. The rendered channel, playlist and category pages also contain tables with links to the videos, channels etc. that they contain.</p>

<p>With the use of Bootstap, YouTubeSWEg works on multiple platforms including mobile devices with no issues and without compromising on user experience. Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS, and JS framework that incorporates responsive and dynamic design that is easy to use and build upon. It provides the tools to create a clean user interface with its pre-stylized elements. The API consists of many predefined templates needed to complete our web app, i.e. the navigation bar and carousel. These predefined templates are easy customize, saving us lot of time that may have otherwise been spent creating basic CSS files and HTML components. The collapsable navigation bar featured on YouTubeSWEg is able to adapt to smaller screens size by placing the tabs into a dropdown menu.</p>

<p>On the instances of our models, we take advantage of Bootstrap’s flexbox grid system, that adjusts the pages’ layout according to the size of the user’s device. This system makes the issue of spacing elements in a web page simple to tackle by dividing each page into a number of columns. Elements of the webpage can be placed into these predefined columns. Although this grid system is used throughout Bootstrap to make it responsive to different screen sizes, we only manually place elements using these columns to format side by side tables in the model of a category instance and in the model a channel instance.</p>

<p>Javascript is used to have our web page interact with user input. During this phase of the project, most of our JS use is to highlight the active tab of the navigation bar. At this point, we have the code for our navigation bar in a JS file, which is called by each of the pages to be displayed. Each page also removes the current active tab of the navigation bar and sets the appropriate tab to active.</p>
<br />
<br />

<a name="Backend"></a>
<h1>Backend</h1>

<p>The backend portion of our website is built upon a variety of different tools including the Google Cloud Platform for hosting the backend server, Flask for rendering HTML templates, and Jinja2 for the  engineering of static and dynamic templates. With the strategic use of Jinja2, we are able to effectively reuse HTML templates for the multiple models present in the website.</p>
<a name="YouTubeDataAPI"></a>
<h2>YouTube Data API</h2>

<p>As the title of the project suggests, we are utilizing the YouTube Data API to collect information. We are collecting information regarding Videos, Channels, Categories, and Playlists. There are several different endpoints present in the YouTube Data API to expose this data. By providing things like category ID’s, video ID’s, region codes, and more, we can find relevant YouTube videos in various scopes.</p>

<p>The reference for the YouTube Data API can be found here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/">https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/</a></p>
<a name="GCP"></a>
<h2>GCP</h2>
 
<p>YouTubeSWEg uses Google Cloud Platform to host our website. Google Cloud Platform is a cloud computing service by Google that offers hosting on the same supporting infrastructure that Google uses internally for end-user products like Google Search and YouTube. Cloud Platform provides developer products to build a range of programs from simple websites to complex applications. GCP was chosen over AWS due to its ease of use when deploying basic Python 3.5 applications that run on the Google App Engine Standard Environment. Google App Engine (often referred to as GAE or simply App Engine) is a cloud computing platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. Applications are sandboxed and run across multiple servers. App Engine offers automatic scaling for web applications—as the number of requests increases for an application, App Engine automatically allocates more resources for the web application to handle the additional demand.</p>

<p>In the current version of the project the appengine_config.py in the root of the flask-app directory contains some basic configuration settings. The libraries that we are using are placed in the lib folder as shown in the configuration.</p>

<p>The configuration file for the GAE is the app.yaml file which contains settings such as python version, API version, the path of the primary script we are running, and path of static data files.</p>

<p>The application is run by GCP through the main.py file.</p>
<a name="InstallingTheGoogleCloudSDK"></a>
<h3>Installing the Google Cloud SDK</h3>

<p>In order to use the Google Cloud Platform, the Google Cloud SDK must be installed. The download can be found here: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/">https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/</a></p>

<p>The SDK tools can then be added to the path through the following command:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 1.8em"><b>./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh</b></p>

<p>Then run gcloud init to initialize the SDK:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 1.8em"><b>gcloud init</b></p>

<p>Note: If the SDK tools are not added to the path, make sure to use the full path of the files in the SDK in all gcloud commands. i.e.  ./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud</p>

<a name="DeployingYourApplication"></a>
<h3>Deploying your application</h3>
<p>To upload the app, run the following command from within the root directory of your project where the app.yaml file is located:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 1.8em"><b>gcloud app deploy</b></p>
<a name="DeployingYourApplicationLocally"></a>
<h3>Deploying your application locally</h3>
<p>In order to deploy the application locally, run:</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 1.8em"><b>python main.py</b></p>

<p>When running the application locally, it is important that the following is added to main.py</p>
<p style="padding-left: 1.8em"><b>if __name__ == '__main__':</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 3.6em"><b>app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080, debug=True)</b></p>

<p>This is needed in order to keep the server listening on the local host through port 8080. Deploying the application locally was essential in reducing debugging and testing time since it allowed us to almost instantaneously view the website after each change. Furthermore, no additional restarts were required after every change since the local changes would immediately reflect on the page. This would simply not be possible if a push to the cloud was done after each change.</p>
<a name="ViewingYourApplication"></a>
<h3>Viewing your application</h3>
<p>To launch your browser and view the app at http://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com, run the following command:</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 1.8em"><b>gcloud app browse</b></p>
<a name="Flask/Jinja2"></a>
<h2>Flask/Jinja2</h2>
<p>GCP simply allows our app to be hosted on the cloud; the backend code, that is the code that handles requests to our website, still does not exist. For this we use Flask and Jinja2.</p>

<p>Currently, the majority of our backend consists of functions that are triggered when certain URLs on our website are accessed. These functions render static html pages and pass them back to the clients that tried to visit our site. By default, Flask leverages Jinja2 as a template engine, so we used it to form finished web pages from our HTML templates using the data we passed it. As a full featured template engine, specifically built for use with Python, Jinja2 has full unicode support, an optional integrated sandboxed execution environment, is widely used and BSD licensed. We did not fully explore all the more intricate features of the tool, but we found that it fit our needs very adequately. Jinja2 allowed us to iterate through the data we provided with extreme ease and perform different actions based on the data provided (e.g. if we were passing a thumbnail image for a YouTube video, we displayed the thumbnail, if we passed a tuple of text and a route to another part of our site, we hyperlinked the the text to the provided route). This allowed us to limit the number of html templates we had to create. We only created a template for the model page and additional templates for each model instance type. One jinja2 feature that we found extremely helpful was the debugging system it provided. Jinja2 in union with Flask is able to integrate template compilation and runtime errors directly into the Python traceback system. Whenever we came across issues with our Jinja2 template, they were made very easy to find due to this fantastic system of displaying the exception traceback.</p>

<p>Flask made running and testing our website very simple. Testing our application locally consisted of simply running our main.py file after installing and importing Flask and setting the app to run at localhost:8080. We were then able to run and debug our code locally, seeing changes and, when they arose, exception tracebacks basically instantaneously. Flask made setting endpoints and behavior at those endpoints very easy, by simply adding @app.route(&lt;endpoint&gt;) before a python function to define the behavior of the app at that endpoint. Right now, our main.py basically holds each of our relations in global data structures, which we pass to the Jinja2 templates with render_template. Though this excessive use of global variables is slightly shy of optimal, we think it is more than adequate for holding and passing the data for the current 12 model instances that we currently have. Once we have an implementation for our API, we will be better able to package and send the data that we scrape from the YouTube API and store in our database.</p>

<p>The backend models that our database will be based on was created using SQLAlchemy. Using the framework, we were able to relatively easily define the attributes and characteristics of each of the models through Python classes. We were also able to define relationships between the different models through the designated syntax. This was done through defining relation tables and invoking the relationship() method within each of the classes as needed. Some of the relations required a one-to-many relationship while others required a one-to-one relationship and yet others required a many-to-many relationship. This was all again handled quite simply through the SQLAlchemy syntax of defining relationships.</p>

<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>

<p>The YouTubeSWEg project is automatically linked to Travis CI through github, however the travis script does not run any other additional tests at the moment. Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub. The configuration file is a hidden file in the root directory, .travis.yml, which defines the script to run and the environment settings. Travis CI is automatically run whenever a change has been made to the github project. Continuous integration is the practice of merging all developer copies to a shared mainline several times a day.</p>
<a name="UnitTests"></a>

<h2>Unit Tests</h2>

<p>There are several extensive unit tests for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and integrity of our backend database models. We ensure that in every potential situation that we were able to foresee, we have tests prepared to assure ourselves that any changes we make to a function do not affect the desired output of the program. There are a total of 15 unit tests spanning the 4 different models present in the application. Each model is tested to ensure that the attributes of the model are present in the expected way. Furthermore, the number of instances of each model that are present in the database are also verified.</p>

<h1>Application Programming Interface (API)</h1>

<p>We have designed an API to expose the data that we are presenting on the website. The API presents various data regarding each of the specific models. The API can be used to retrieve data regarding videos, channels, categories, and playlists. Furthermore, there are multiple additional parameters for each of the endpoints so that more specific data can be retrieved. For example, in the videos endpoint of the API, there are optional parameters for ID, Channel ID, and Category ID. If these parameters are provided, only videos that are linked to those ID’s are returned in the response. Since videos are directly linked to channels and categories in our database itself, this is an accurate representation of how we are presenting the data on the website. The other models presented in the API also follow a similar pattern of optional parameters to narrow down the response in various ways.</p>

<h1>UML Diagram</h1>

<p>We have prepared a UML diagram of our models in order to lay out the general behavior of each of our models and their interactions with each other. Each model is drawn with their respective attributes, and each of the models have an arrow with cardinalities to represent the relationships between the models. For example, Channel is pointed to by all three of the other models, Video, Playlist, and Category, because each of these point to an instance or instances of Channel.</p>
